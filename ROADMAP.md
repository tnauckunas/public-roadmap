# Tomas Nauckunas — Full-Spectrum Tech Project Roadmap  
_A Zero-to-DevSecOps Buildout | Real-World Problems → Real Proof_

This roadmap documents my zero-to-one evolution across IT, DevOps, security, scripting, and automation. Every project listed was born from real pain — systems I personally fixed, rebuilt, or reinvented from scratch.  
No courses. No fluff. Just delivered capability and proof.

- Learn and deploy **Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines**  
- Build systems that solve **real user pain points**  
- Transition from QA → **DevSecOps / Automation Engineer**

## Repo Architecture Blueprint  

Every major repo includes:

- `README.md` → Clear purpose, scope, and features  
- `TODO.md` → Task planning + milestone tracker  
- `logs/` → Real screenshots, scans, or script output  
- `assets/` → Proof photos, visual walk-throughs
