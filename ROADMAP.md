# Tomas Nauckunas – Public Project Roadmap

This public roadmap is a high-impact tracker for my monthly project development, technical mastery, and hands-on innovation across IT, DevOps, cybersecurity, and automation domains. Each project below is born from real-world friction systems I’ve personally fixed, rebuilt, or automated from scratch. No theory, no fluff, just delivered proof of capability.

## Repo Architecture Strategy

Every major repo includes:

- `README.md` → Clear purpose, scope, features
- `TODO.md` → Task planning + milestone tracker
- `logs/` → Real screenshots, scans, or script output
- `assets/` → Proof photos, visual walk-throughs
