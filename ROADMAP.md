# Tomas Nauckunas – Public Project Roadmap

This roadmap is a live tracker for my personal project development, technical growth, and monthly output goals. Each project reflects a real-world pain point, something I’ve personally encountered, and rebuilt from the ground up hands-on, no fluff.

## Repo Roadmap Strategy

Every major repo will contain:

* `README.md` → full breakdown of purpose, scope, and features
* `TODO.md` → feature backlog + progress log
* `logs/` folder → real screenshots, photos, scan logs, or manual test results
* `assets/` folder → annotated proof visuals
