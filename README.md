# Tomas Nauckunas – Public Roadmap Hub

This repository tracks my ongoing portfolio development across multiple domains including IT support, DevOps, mobile apps, field repair engineering, and automation scripting. Each project reflects a real-world pain point I've personally solved hands-on, rebuilt from the ground up, and documented with no fluff.

## Contents

- `ROADMAP.md` – Full public development tracker
- `TODO.md` – Feature backlog & task logs (per project)
- `assets/` – Visual documentation, repair proof, annotated screenshots
- `logs/` – Scan logs, test outputs, raw markdown result files

## Core Projects

| Repo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Sempre-Health QA](https://github.com/tnauckunas/sempre-health-qa-support-log) | Documents live QA, troubleshooting, and integration tasks performed during my tenure at Sempre Health |
| [IT Field Tech](https://github.com/tnauckunas/field-system-reinstall-log) | Image-documented archive of repair, install, transport, testing, and QA logs |

| [Clearance Scanner US & UK](https://github.com/tnauckunas/store_clearance-scanner) | Python-based CLI to detect unlisted retail clearance deals |
| `public-roadmap` | This repo – tracks all repo progress and execution flow |

## Repo Structure Strategy

Every high-impact repo includes:

- `README.md` → Purpose, scope, and features
- `TODO.md` → Task log + milestone tracker
- `logs/` → Screenshots, scans, or test outputs
- `assets/` → Real proof visuals or annotated images
