# Tomas Nauckunas – Public Roadmap Hub

This repository tracks my ongoing portfolio development across multiple domains including IT support, DevOps, mobile apps, field repair engineering, and automation scripting. Each project reflects a real-world pain point I've personally solved hands-on, rebuilt from the ground up, and documented with no fluff.

## Repo Structure Strategy

Every high-impact repo includes:

- `TODO.md` → Task log + milestone tracker
- `logs/` → Screenshots, scans, or test outputs
- `assets/` → Real proof visuals or annotated images
