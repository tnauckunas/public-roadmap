# Tomas Nauckunas – Public Roadmap Hub

This repository tracks my ongoing portfolio development across multiple domains including IT support, DevOps, mobile apps, field repair engineering, and automation scripting. Each project reflects a real-world pain point I've personally solved hands-on, rebuilt from the ground up, and documented with no fluff.

## Contents

- `ROADMAP.md` – Full public development tracker
- `TODO.md` – Feature backlog & task logs (per project)
- `assets/` – Visual documentation, repair proof, annotated screenshots
- `logs/` – Scan logs, test outputs, raw markdown result files

## Core Projects

| Repo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [appliance-repair](https://github.com/tnauckunas/sempre-health-qa-support-log) | Real-world appliance fix logs, with before/after photos |
| `vehicle-repair` | Head gasket tear-down, hybrid cooling system repair |
| `trailer-wiring` | Full 7-pin harness + junction rebuild with color-coded documentation |
| `clearance-scanner-suite` | Python-based CLI to detect unlisted retail clearance deals |
| `public-roadmap` | This repo – tracks all repo progress and execution flow |

## Repo Structure Strategy

Every high-impact repo includes:

- `README.md` → Purpose, scope, and features
- `TODO.md` → Task log + milestone tracker
- `logs/` → Screenshots, scans, or test outputs
- `assets/` → Real proof visuals or annotated images
